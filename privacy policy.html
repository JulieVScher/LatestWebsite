                        <h4>Executive Functioning Skills</h4>
                        <p>Executive functioning refers to a person's ability to process information, including skills such as organizing, planning, paying attention, and inhibiting inappropriate responses. Many individuals with autism experience challenges with executive functioning, including difficulty with planning, organization, sequencing information, and regulating emotions. Some individuals may have difficulty seeing how small details fit into a bigger picture, while others struggle with maintaining attention in different settings. Planning tasks may be difficult for some individuals, as they struggle to organize their thoughts and actions and figure out the sequence of steps needed. Poor impulse control may also be associated with executive functioning difficulties. Complex thinking that involves holding more than one train of thought simultaneously may also be challenging for some individuals.</p>

This guidance should cover essential life skills such as money management, cooking, shopping, room organization, and transportation. The training should be conducted in natural environments, where the individual will live, to ensure that the skills being taught are relevant to the environment.</p>

                            <p>To actively participate in community life, individuals with autism must possess the crucial skill of self-regulation. A significant number of adolescents with autism often struggle with sensory overload, making it challenging to comprehend their emotions and manage their reactions effectively. This can pose a significant obstacle to social engagement. Therefore, it is vital to provide them with the necessary support and tools to learn how to regulate their emotions and sensory input. This can help them better navigate various social scenarios and interact with others positively.</p>
